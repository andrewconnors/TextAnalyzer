# TextAnalyzer
Counts frequent words in a text file and orders them for analytic purposes

I have hopes to add a predictor to this project to determine Genre of Book for a current project. 

## To Run

Using the cases provided in the test-cases folder change the hard-coded filename to the book you would like to analyze (I know, I know- cmd line args). 
then run the project by running ```python text-analyzer.py``` after installing dependancies.
